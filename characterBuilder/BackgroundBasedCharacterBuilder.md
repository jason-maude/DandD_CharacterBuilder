# A background based character builder for D&D 5th edition
## By Jason Maude (@jasonmaude)
VERSION 0.001

## Designer’s Notes
I love roleplaying, and D&D is one of my favourite systems. It isn’t perfect, but then nothing is. I fundamentally believe that everything can be improved, and that gradual continuous improvement is at the core of being a good human. This work represents my attempt to make D&D better.

My work on this was largely inspired by a problem that I have had for a while with many games (not just D&D): humans as a default. I have always had a nagging sense of discomfort from games where you can play as multiple different races or species all of which have different powers, except the humans whose power is something along the lines of “flexibility” or “being slightly better than average at everything.” It encourages a situation in which all of the races/species are encouraged down a certain path in the game, except the humans who can be whatever they want to be.

This nagging discomfort was crystallized into an actual problem when I read about the experiences of D&D players who weren’t white. The mythology of D&D is built on centuries of stories, myths, and legends. The rules and gameplay of D&D is built upon that mythology. Unfortunately some of that mythology derives from legends that were racist, sexist, or had what we would consider today to be immoral messages. These messages still persist in the game, and make some players (or potential players) uncomfortable. I want D&D to be enjoyed by everyone who wants to participate, in order to do that we need to remove the barriers caused by these immoral messages, whilst still retaining the parts of the myths and legends that make it an awesome game to play.

And so I started with what any player new to the game will encounter first (or at least very soon after they start): character creation. As has been pointed out by many people the character creation system in D&D has some racist undertones. Races or species in sci-fi and fantasy often mirror the races or nationalities in our own world. This makes it uncomfortable for some people when characters in D&D have ability scores determined by their race. This encourages people to pick their race based on the class they want to play. There’s nothing to stop you playing a Dwarvern Bard, but you’ll get better stats and be more effective if you play a Half-Elf Bard. The message: “some races are just better at certain jobs” is a real life racist message, and one that will discourage potential players from playing this fantastic game. In order to correct this I have created a system where your starting stat bonuses and abilities are based almost entirely on your background and your class (the only exception being your starting languages).

One important caveat: This has had next to no play-testing, so use with the consent of your group and at your own risk. I will make an effort to gather feedback and improve the system as I receive it.

I’m not seeking to make any money out of this, so I’m putting it out into the world free of charge. See the legal section of this document for further important legal notes.

One last note: Thanks to Wizards of the Coast for publishing D&D and continuing to improve it. Thank you also to them for creating the Open Gaming License and System Reference Document that make fan works like this possible.

## How to use this guide
This guide outlines an alternative method of building characters for Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition. This is designed to replace the racial attributes and background choices used in character creation. It does not replace any of the class powers.

The first thing to note before using this character builder is: Consult your GM and the rest of your group first. If you’re all happy to use it then go ahead.
### Character Creation
If you want to use this character builder use the following steps to design your character. Don’t worry especially about getting everything right first time, designing a character is often an iterative process. Feel free to revisit some steps and changing the decisions you made after you consider later steps.
#### 1 - Write your character’s story
Write the story of your character. This doesn’t have to be a whole novel, but should include the main elements of their life and how they got to where they are at the start of the adventure. It should include elements such as:
* Growing up - What environment did they grow up in? Who raised them? What ideals were they raised with?
* Society - What was the society around them like? What was the culture? What was their attitude to celebration, worship, fighting, magic etc.
* Formative events - What major decisions or events have influenced their life and how?
* Physical traits - What does their body look like? How do they move and present themselves to the world? What race are they? What gender? How do they dress?
* Character traits - What positive traits do they have? What challenges do they face, both internally and externally?
* Skills - What are they good at and what are they bad at?
* Hopes and dreams - What do they want to accomplish? What are their goals?
* Immediate circumstances - How did they get to where the adventure starts from?
#### 2 - Determine ability scores
Based on your character’s story determine your base ability scores. Methods for determining ability scores are listed on pages 12 and 13 of the Player’s Handbook. Ask your GM as to which system you will be using.
#### 3 - Choose your background
Your character starts off knowing two languages: Common and one other language appropriate to the area/culture you grew up in.

Based on your character’s story choose backgrounds from the list below. The backgrounds are divided into four groups:
* Formative landscape - Describes the different geographies in which your character could have grown up or spent a formative period of their life.
* Professions - Describes various professions that your character could have had before becoming an adventurer.
* Battle tactics - Describes the ways in which your character participates in battle.
* Supernatural interventions - Describes various supernatural beings that could have intervened in your character’s life and the effects that could have had on your character.

Out of all of the backgrounds available pick three. These backgrounds give you the following benefits:
* A benefit, ability, language, or set of proficiencies associated with the background.
* A choice of stats to increase. For each background choose one of the available attributes and give your character a +1 bonus in that attribute.
* Access to a list of feats. You do not gain all the feats for your background. Instead choose four of the feats from those listed for your chosen backgrounds.

I suggest the following restrictions when choosing backgrounds and feats. Feel free to ignore any/all of these. Ignoring them may lead to some unbalanced characters:
* Choose no more than one background from each of the four groups (exception: for an intelligence based character perhaps two professions would be appropriate).
* Choose at least one feat from each background that you have chosen.
* Don’t choose the same attribute to increase for all of your backgrounds.
#### 4 - Choose your class
As described in the Player’s Handbook.
#### 5 - Choose starting equipment
Your character starts with the starting equipment of their class, any starting equipment defined by their background, and starting money for their class as defined on page 143 of the Player’s Handbook which can be used to buy extra starting equipment.
### Ability Score Increases
Whenever your character gets an ASI as a result of levelling up you may do one of the following:
* Gain +2 in one ability score
* Gain +1 in two different ability scores
* Choose one of your backgrounds - gain +1 in one of the ability scores associated with that background and gain a feat from that background that you do not already have.
## Backgrounds - Formative Landscape
### From the City
You grew up in a large town or city. High and low alike rub shoulders on the streets, and many unlikely friendships and partnerships are formed. You are at your most comfortable walking around the crowded streets of a large metropolis, especially your own home town or city. You know where the traffic is going to be, and how to use short-cuts and back alleys to navigate the urban landscape effectively. Once you have been in a town or city for at least one day you may travel from one part of that town/city to another part in half the time it normally takes. If you leave the town/city for more than a week and then return you will need a day to reacclimatise yourself. This restriction does not apply to your home town or city.

**Ability score increase: Dexterity or Intelligence**
#### Cellar Dweller
A lot of what goes on in the city actually goes on underneath it. Tunnels and ruins of the city’s past provide extra passages for those who know where to find them and how to use them. You spent much of your life using these tunnels, perhaps for honest purposes, or nefarious ones, or maybe just to get around. You have learnt to spot hidden doors and loose parts of a wall that you could sneak through.
* You have darkvision of 60 feet.
* You are proficient in all checks made to search for hidden doors and secret passages. If you are already proficient in the skill being used to make the check you may double your proficiency bonus.
#### Day Laborer
The flow of goods through a city is like the flow of blood through the body. Cities are constantly in need of goods being transported from one part of the city to another to keep the life of the city going. This is a constant and reliable source of work for anyone who wants to take it up. You spent some time making a living in this way and grew used to moving heavy crates and boxes through the busy streets at speed.
* You are proficient in athletics.
* Your normal carrying capacity is doubled.
#### Market Trader
Most things can be found for sale in the city. You spent a lot of time in the market area, hunting for bargains, watching the people buy and sell wares, or trying to flog stuff yourself. You have a keen eye for whether someone is proposing a good deal or is trying to fleece you.
* You are proficient in insight or persuasion.
* You are proficient in all checks made to assess the quality of mundane items or the intentions of a seller of such items. If you are already proficient in the skill being used you may double your proficiency bonus. The GM may decide what classes as mundane, and thus to what this bonus would apply.
#### Plague Survivor
Many people living in close proximity to each other is an invitation for diseases of all sorts to take hold. At one point in your life you were struck down with a virulent plague that ran through your home town/city. You were not expected to survive, but unexpectedly pulled through. This may have left you with some scars or a mark of the plague, but it has also inoculated you somewhat against future illnesses.
* You have advantage on all saving throws made to resist poison or disease.
* If a poison or disease would apply any levels of exhaustion to you, you may ignore the first level applied.
#### Tavern Gossip
The currency of a city is just as much information as it is money. Crucial rumours and tidbits of information can be very valuable to allow an opportunity to be seized minutes before a rival gets to it. When walking into a tavern / inn / other drinking establishment you will be able to tell within a few minutes what sort of clientele frequent it and will be able to spot anyone who looks out of place. If you purchase a round of drinks for some of the patrons you will automatically be able to learn any local rumours or gossip. 
### From the Desert
You grew up in an arid area of the world. Maybe it was filled with endless sand dunes, or perhaps sparse vegetation and hard cracked ground. Life there was hard and taught you to conserve and use efficiently what little resources you had. You are unaffected by the effects of extreme heat and can go for up to two days with no water without suffering ill effects.

**Ability score increase: Constitution or Wisdom**
#### Child of the Wilderness
You are at home in the wilderness, wandering in the vast open spaces of the world. You are an expert in surviving beyond the bounds of what the pampered refer to as civilization. However you are not used to the crowded interior of large cities, and become extremely uncomfortable when forced into situations with many, many people living in a confined space.
* You have advantage on perception and survival checks when you are in the wilderness at least 5 miles from the nearest town or similar settlement.
* You have disadvantage on persuasion and deception checks when you are in a large town or city.
#### Magic of the Desert
Those who survive out in the barren, windswept environs of a desert often fall back on simple magics to be able to survive. You gain access to the following spells. Wisdom is your casting ability for these spells.
* At 1st level: you gain the Resistance cantrip.
* At 3rd level: you gain the ability to cast Create or Destroy Water once per long rest, although you may only use the create feature of this spell (why would anyone want to destroy water?).
* At 5th level: you gain the ability to cast Gust of Wind once per long rest.
#### Mirage Breaker
The extreme heat of the desert can play tricks on the mind. You have learnt to see what is real and what is not. You have advantage on all ability checks and saving throws made to see through illusions and resist their effects. This also applies to any spells from the Illusion school of magic. If the GM wants to hide the fact that what you are resisting is an illusion then they can instead lower the DC of the check for you by 5.
#### Pathfinder
As you follow paths or tracks through the wilderness you take care to ensure that you do not get turned around in the rather featureless environment and become lost amongst the dunes. You also know how to navigate the obscuring weather that a desert will often throw your way.
* You are proficient in perception or survival.
* You have an excellent memory for terrain and geography, and will rarely get lost in normal circumstances.
* You are proficient in any ability checks or saving throws made to navigate or survive in obscuring weather (whether natural or not), such as fog or sandstorms. If you already are proficient in the skill/saving throw being used to make the check you may double your proficiency bonus.
#### Shelter Seeker
In the desert one must always know where to take shelter in the cold of night or when a sandstorm approaches. You have learnt how to quickly locate shelter in even the most inhospitable of climes.
* You are proficient in nature or survival.
* You are proficient in any check made to find a safe place to set up camp in the wild. If you are already proficient in the skill being used for the ability check you may double your proficiency bonus.
### From the Forest
You grew up amongst beautiful tall trees, their protective canopy towering over you. The forest is home to all manner of plants, animals, and humanoids all of whom live together in harmony, of a sort. Your knowledge of the forest allows you to make maximum use of the foliage around you to conceal yourself. While you are in an area with trees or foliage you may attempt to hide yourself even if you are only lightly obscured.

Ability score increase: Dexterity or Wisdom
#### Beast Tamer
Living in the crowded natural environment of the forest you soon learn how to communicate, in a fairly primitive way, with the beasts around you. Establishing who is dominant in an unexpected encounter or indicating that you are no easy prey for a hungry predator is vital to survival. You have learnt how to clearly communicate your intentions to beasts.
* You are proficient in animal handling or intimidation.
* You are proficient in any ability check made to scare away or soothe hostile or suspicious beasts. If you already are proficient in the skill being used for the ability check then you may double your proficiency bonus.
#### Forager
The forest is an excellent source of food and water, if you can find it. You learnt to scavenge for berries and small fowl and game. You also learnt how to live on meat that was slightly off, or berries that had some unfortunate side effects. After all, if there’s nothing else to eat, sometimes the cramps are worth it.
* You have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.
* As long as the land provides food and water you can find it. You can always find enough sustenance for up to 5 people a day (as long as the land provides it).
#### Lumberjack
Skill with harvesting and using wood is almost a given for those who grow up in the forest. You have chopped more wood in your time than you care to remember. You have the well defined muscles of someone used to swinging an axe and a knowledge of which woods are best used to craft which objects. You also have the skills to form that wood into the shape that you want.
* You are proficient in either athletics or nature.
* You are proficient with carpenter’s tools.
* You start the game with a set of carpenter’s tools.
#### Magic of the Forest
You have learnt to draw on the magical power of plants and trees to a limited extent, this allows you access to some basic magics. You gain access to the spells listed below. Wisdom is your casting ability for these spells.
* At 1st level: you gain the Mending cantrip, although it only works for things made out of plant or animal matter (i.e. not stone or metal).
* At 3rd level: you gain the ability to cast Detect Poison and Disease once per long rest.
* At 5th level: you gain the ability to cast Spider Climb once per long rest.
#### Tree Climber
The trees of the forest provide an excellent place to hide. You have a lot of practice hiding from enemies, or concealing yourself from the animal you were hunting. Once you have scurried up into the branches you can make yourself virtually undetectable.
* You have a climb speed of 20ft.
* Whilst you are in the branches of a tree (at least 10ft off the ground) you may make stealth checks with proficiency. If you are already proficient in stealth you may double your proficiency bonus.
### From the Mountains
You grew up in the chilly heights and windy passes of a mountain range. You learnt to respect the glorious splendour of the high mountain tops, as avalanches and crevasses could quickly turn the beautiful landscape into a deadly trap. Climbing over the high ridges has given you a natural ability to scale what look like impossibly sheer surfaces. You have a climb speed of 20ft.

**Ability score increase: Constitution or Wisdom**
#### Cave Explorer
There are many caves and crevasses in the high mountains in which people can get trapped. You were taught how not to get trapped in those situations, and how to rescue those who got caught.
* You have darkvision of 60ft.
* You are proficient in any ability check made to assess or make your way through a narrow enclosed space, whether natural (such as a cave or crevasse) or manufactured (such as a crawl space or narrow tunnel). If you are already proficient in the skill you are using to make that ability check you may double your proficiency bonus.
#### Frost Skin
The air is thin up on the mountain tops, the shelter rare, and the temperature is rarely warm. Some days not even the thickest furs will protect you from the all pervasive cold. You have spent so long out in the cold and elements that your skin may as well be made from frost.
* You are resistant to cold damage.
* You are unaffected by problems or penalties caused by cold or rainy weather.
* You are unaffected by problems or penalties caused by high altitude.
#### Magic of the Peaks
Your family had magic that kept them alive in the mountains, they have passed some of that on to you. Wisdom is your casting ability for these spells.
* At 1st level: you gain the Create Bonfire cantrip, though it cannot be used as an attack.
* At 3rd level: you gain the ability to cast Longstrider once per long rest.
* At 5th level: you gain the ability to cast Locate Animals or Plants once per long rest.
#### Sure Footed
Like the goats that roam the mountains you learnt exactly where to put your feet such that you would not slip and fall or, if you did, how to catch yourself.
* You are proficient in acrobatics or survival.
* You are unaffected by any penalties caused by rocky, icy, or snow-bound terrain. This includes not having to treat such terrain as difficult terrain for the purposes of movement.
* You have advantage on any checks required to cross such terrains.
### From the Plains
You grew up on flat or rolling grassland. You are used to the wide open spaces of the wilderness where there is nowhere to hide. Many people think that such terrain makes you soft, but they are mistaken. The endless grasslands, plains, and prairies can be just as dangerous as the high mountains or the dense jungles. At least out in the endless flats you have the advantage that you can spot danger coming from a long way off. You have advantage on perception checks when in open terrain where you can see for at least half a mile.

**Ability score increase: Strength or Constitution**
#### Ground Hider
Hiding from enemies in such a featureless environment is a tricky skill. You have practiced the art of using even the slightest ridge or bump in the road as a means of concealment. The best thing about hiding in this way is that almost no-one sees the ambush coming, after all, who can hide on flat ground?
* You are proficient in stealth.
* While not actively engaged in combat and when no enemies can see you, you may attempt to hide even if there are no features by dropping prone. You may double your proficiency bonus for the stealth check required to do this.
* If you ambush an enemy from this position you do an extra d6 damage to any enemy that you hit who is surprised. This extra damage increases to 2d6 at level 5, 3d6 at level 11, and 4d6 at level 16.
#### Long Distance Runner
The wide open plains with their large gaps between outposts of civilization encourages people to learn how to move fast, even when mounts aren’t available. You have learnt how to run for long periods without getting tired.
* You are proficient in athletics.
* Whenever you take the dash action you gain an additional 10ft of movement for the round (note that this is 10ft total, not 10ft per movement).
#### Rancher
You and/or your family kept a large herd of beasts from which you harvested milk, meat, and furs. You learnt how to manage these herds on the wide open plains and how to bring them to market in the nearest town. You left that life with your faithful companion, the mount that you used to round up your flock or herd.
* You are proficient in animal handling.
* You begin the game with a basic mount, such as a horse.
#### Wagon Convoy Hand
The use of convoys of carts and wagons to travel the plains is a widely used practice. Safety in numbers helps discourage attack by beasts or bandits. If an attack does come experienced convoy hands know how to use their carts as a defense against the aggressors.
* You are proficient in animal handling or perception.
* You are proficient with land vehicles
* You may use any land vehicle you or your party own as cover. The cover bonus of any land vehicle you or your party own is improved by one level (i.e. half cover becomes three-quarters cover etc)
### From the Sea
You grew up on the coast, surrounded by the sounds of crashing waves and the wide open vista of blue stretching before you. Or perhaps you grew up not next to the sea, but under it. Growing up in such an environment often places you quite literally in a sink or swim situation so you have learnt how to survive. You have a swim speed of 30ft.

**Ability score increase: Strength or Wisdom**
#### Aquan
Your people hail not from around the sea but from under it. You are used to living under the waters, and coming up to walk amongst the surface dwellers is an odd experience. You do particularly badly when the air is dry.
* You can breathe both air and water and suffer no ill effects from the pressures of the deep sea.
* You can speak and read Primordial, the elemental language of many undersea creatures.
* If you are in desert conditions for too long you suffer ill effects. You will suffer one level of exhaustion after being in desert conditions (either cold or hot) for 5 days, and an additional level after 10 days. In addition, you may not recover levels of exhaustion until you have left the desert terrain.
#### Beach Comber
You walked the beaches around where you lived looking for the items that had been washed up by the incoming tide. Many days you would find nothing but junk, but occasionally you would find a treasure.
* You are proficient in either investigation or perception.
* You are proficient in assessing the worth of an object. If you are already proficient in the skill you are using to make the ability check you may double your proficiency bonus.
* You start the game with an item worth up to 20 GP that you found washed up on the beach.
#### Diver
A lot of interesting things can be found on the seabed. You fished for pearls and other sunken treasures in the depths. You have learnt to control your breathing so that you can spend longer pulling up the juiciest finds.
* You are proficient in athletics.
* You are able to hold your breath for up to 15 minutes with no ill effects.
#### Fisherman
You spent many a quiet day sitting in your boat with net, rod, or spear, waiting for dinner to swim by. You are practiced in gathering and cooking fish and seafood and can support a party, so long as there is water nearby.
* You are proficient in operating water vehicles.
* You can provide enough fish or seafood to feed up to 5 people a day if you are near a river, on the coast, or sailing the seas.
* You start the game with fishing equipment: a fishing rod or spear, bait, and a net.
#### Magic of the Sea
You have learnt some magic from your people that allows you to manipulate the water all around you. Wisdom is you spell casting ability for these spells. If you are in desert conditions you will not be able to cast these spells.
* At 1st level: you gain the Shape Water cantrip.
* At 3rd level: you gain the ability to cast Fog Cloud once per long rest.
* At 5th level: you gain the ability to cast Mirror Image once per long rest.
### From the Underdark
You have spent much of your life in the dark. Maybe as a miner, smuggler, denizen of an underground city, resident in a zone where sunlight does not reach, or something else entirely. In any case your eyes have adjusted to life in the dark. You gain darkvision of 60ft.

**Ability score increase: Dexterity or Charisma**
#### Deep Dweller
You live in the deepest and darkest of the dark regions. You are at home and comfortable in the pitch black, whereas the bright light of the day is unnerving.
* Your darkvision extends to 120 ft.
* You know Undercommon, the language of the depths.
* You have disadvantage on perception checks made in daylight.
#### Magic of the Dark
You have learnt to navigate and defend yourself in the dark with some magical defenses. Charisma is your spell casting ability for these spells.
* At 1st level: you gain the Dancing Lights cantrip
* At 3rd level: you gain the ability to cast Faerie Fire once per long rest
* At 5th level: you gain the ability to cast Darkness once per long rest
#### Skulker
You have become an expert in using the dark in combat. You strike from the shadows at your foes and then fade away before they can locate you. The following benefits apply when you are in dim (or lower) light conditions:
* You can hide even when only lightly obscured.
* Whilst you are hidden attacking does not reveal your position.
#### Trap Avoider
Many creatures of the dark seek to use deadly traps to defend themselves. In the dark such things are easily hidden and can quickly dispose of the unwary. You have learnt how to avoid such traps and to minimise the damage you take from them.
* You are proficient in all saving throws that you are forced to make by traps. If you already are proficient in the saving throw being made then you may double your proficiency bonus.
* You are resistant to all damage dealt by traps.
#### Tunnel Expert
One hazard that topside dwellers need not worry about is the ceiling collapsing in on them. A shoddly designed tunnel or incorrectly placed mine prop can spell death for the unwary. You have learnt how to spot such problems and how to dive out of the way when the roof (or floor) caves in.
* You are proficient in acrobatics or investigation.
* You have advantage on any saving throw required to avoid things falling on you in an enclosed space or as a result of the ground collapsing out from under you. Enclosed space in this sense would include being inside a standard building.

## Backgrounds - Professions
### Academic
You have spent years amongst books, scrolls, and other stores of the written word. You have studied some truly obscure texts and have learnt about things both magical and mundane, extraordinary and everyday. You have many colleagues who have studied like you and have collaborated on some important works. Your time in academia means that you are well versed in where knowledge is stored in the world in which you live. If you do not know something, you will know where to find the knowledge you seek. You will be able to point to a library, scriptorium, sage, or long forgotten location where that knowledge is stored. Depending on how obscure the knowledge is the GM may give you anything from an exact location to a general area.

**Ability score increase: Intelligence or Wisdom**
#### Cartographic Studies
You have spent many happy hours in rooms full of maps. Maps can communicate so much about both the terrain and societies of the world and how the two interact with each other. You also spent time investigating how maps were made and learned the craft of the map maker.

* You are proficient with catographer’s tools.
* You start the game with a set of catographer’s tools.
#### Extraplanar Studies

* You are proficient in either arcana or religion.
* Pick three planes other than the material plane. You are proficient in all intelligence based checks made to know things about those planes and the creatures that inhabit them. If you are already proficient in the skill you are using to make such a check then you may double your proficiency bonus.

During your research you have uncovered a piece of forgotten lore that would have a powerful impact on the world if it were known. You have obsessively studied this subject and are now the world’s leading authority on it, not that anyone knows that.
* You are proficient in investigation or another intelligence based skill that relates to the hidden lore you have uncovered.
* You know a powerful and unique secret about the world in which you live. Work out the details of this secret and its effect on the campaign with your GM.

* You are proficient in one intelligence based skill that you are not already proficient in.
* You have membership of a prestigious library, university, or other centre of learning in the world. Work out the details with the GM.
### Acolyte
You have spent time as an acolyte of a particular faith. Your time consisted of worship, living and working with the community of the faithful, and helping those in need. You and your fellow followers of the faith consider yourselves to be brothers and sisters, not by blood, but by something greater. Choose a god to worship and/or religious cause to follow. Fellow worshipers will give you aid and shelter where they can (although just for you, not for your party). They will also provide healing to you or your party if required. Note that more specialised forms of healing will only be available at certain larger communities and you will need to provide any components required to cast the spell.

**Ability score increase: Constitution or Wisdom**
#### Clerical Training
You have been taught to be able to call on your faith to cast some simple magic. Gain two cantrips of your choice from the Cleric cantrips list. Wisdom is your spellcasting attribute for these spells.
#### Faithful Guardian
Part of your service to your god involved the guarding of a strange and powerful evil. This could have been a malevolent artifact, tome of forbidden knowledge, or even an imprisoned demon or devil. The evil force was not contained entirely and occasionally would lash out at you or attempt to seduce your mind with dark desires. You were taught by your fellow worshippers how to guard your mind against the machinations of your charge.
* You are resistant to necrotic damage.
* You have advantage on all saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
#### Healer’s Training

* You are proficient in either medicine or religion. 
* When you use a healer’s kit to stabilise a creature make a medicine check and consult the below:
** 9 or less: The creature is stabilised as normal
** 10 to 19: The creature immediately returns to 1 HP.
** 20 or more: The creature immediately returns to 1 HP and may expend 1 hit die.
#### Pilgrim
You have made a long and arduous journey to a place of significant importance to your faith. The way was hard and not all of your fellow pilgrims made it, but your faith helped you endure to the end. Making the pilgrimage taught you a valuable lesson about detachment from the material world, and the divine blessings you accrued from your journey are still with you to this day.
* You are proficient in either religion or survival.
* You may go up to two days without sleep or food without suffering any ill effects.
#### Scriptural Studies
You have spent time studying various religious texts. You have gained knowledge not only about your faith but also about the myriad of other faiths in the world. In addition you have gained an appreciation of the language and structure of religious texts and understand how to uncover hidden meanings from them.
* You are proficient in religion. 
* Whenever you are making a religion check to study written text you may double your proficiency bonus. 
* You start the game with a small book of religious scripture. Work out the details of this book with your DM.
#### Shepherd of the Faithful
You were given a position of responsibility in your community and spent some time ministering the faithful.

You guided the faithful in acts of worship, service to the community, celebration of life, and mourning of death.
* You are proficient in either insight or religion.
* You know two additional languages used by your local community of worshippers.
### Criminal
Not every profession is honest, not every job within the law. Some people choose to seek the rewards of a criminal lifestyle, some are forced into a life of crime in order to survive. For most it is a little of both. After all, in this world, only those who are adaptable will survive. And sometimes that adaptability has to extend to morality and the law. You weren’t alone in your criminal enterprises, and your time spent amongst this fraternity has taught you thieves’ cant, the special coded language, of symbols, signs, and slang that criminals use to communicate.

#### Burglary
People normally keep their most valuable possessions under lock and key in a secure location. You have become a practiced expert in breaking into even the most secure of locations to gain access to such valuables. From casing the joint, to waiting for the opportune moment to strike, to tripping every lock and trap you can find, you are a professional burglar worthy of the name.
* You are proficient in either perception or stealth.
* You have proficiency with thieves' tools.
* You start the game with a set of thieves’ tools.
#### Enforcer
Just because criminals live outside the law of the land doesn’t mean that no laws apply. Criminals have to stick by some codes to ensure that there isn’t anarchy in the criminal community.

* You are proficient in either deception or intimidation.
* You can get away with some petty acts of crime without being challenged due to your fearsome manner and/or reputation.
#### Fence
Stealing objects or information is only half of the story when profiting from a life of crime. Few shops will be willing to give you change for a priceless diamond. Finding the right buyer for stolen goods is a skill just as important as lifting the goods in the first place. You also need to find a buyer who isn’t going to screw you over. After all you can hardly go complaining to the law if the deal goes south.
* You are proficient in either investigation or persuasion.
* You know how to find people who deal in stolen goods, banned information, or illicit substances. When you move to a new area you can find such people (if there are any to be found) automatically with an hour’s work and have advantage on any roll needed to convince them to trust you.
#### Pickpocket
Many people keep their most treasured possessions about their person so that they can keep an eye on them. Of course they can’t watch them all the time. That brief window in which they are not looking is when you strike. Then of course you must beat a hasty retreat.
* You are proficient in either sleight of hand or stealth.
* Your movement increases by 5ft per round.
#### Smuggler
Goods that are legal in one place may be banned completely in another. Legal goods may incur a fee to move across a border or into a city. Your crime was moving goods discreetly over these borders or around guard posts to avoid the stern gaze of the law and to provide your customers with the goods they wanted at an affordable price. This meant moving large quantities of cargo at night, often through secret tunnels and down hidden passageways, and thinking on your feet when you were caught.
* You are proficient in either deception or stealth.
* You know one language associated with your smuggling routes.
* You have darkvision of 60 feet.
#### Trap Disarming
If only sneaking past some guards and breaking into a building was all that was required to steal priceless treasures.

Fortunately you are very good at disarming such traps.
* You have proficiency with acrobatics or sleight of hand.
* You are proficient with thieves tools.
* Your proficiency bonus for using thieves tools is doubled when you are attempting to disarm a trap.
#### Underworld Contacts
Thieves stick together, bound by the thieves code (even if they are only guidelines). You are (or were) part of a gang or criminal network. Maybe it wasn’t that formalised and you just had a few friends who also lived on the other side of the law. You are still in contact with these contacts (whoever they are) and can tap them up for information, advice, or leads.
* You are proficient in either deception or sleight of hand.
* You have a criminal contact who can provide you with information and some assistance as well as put you in touch with other criminals. Work out the details of this with your GM.
### Entertainer
Life would not be worth living without art and the beauty it manifests. You have stood in front of crowds and delighted them with your talents. Perhaps your name is known across the land, or maybe just among the barflies at one particular tavern. Either way you know how to draw a crowd. You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern, but occasionally somewhere more grand. You can receive free modest lodging as long as you perform each night. People in the area in which you perform will be generally well disposed to you.

**Ability score increase: Dexterity or Charisma**

* You are proficient in either deception or performance.
* You have proficiency with disguise kits.
* You start the game with a disguise kit.
#### Dancer
Your moves are graceful and lithe. You are in full control of your body, something that took years of practice to achieve. Previously you have used this to entrance audiences. In battle however your movements become something much more deadly.

* You can sometimes slide out of the way of seemingly inevitable blows. You have the following ability which may be used once between each long rest:
  **Dancer’s grace** (reaction): When a creature that you can see hits you with an attack roll you may force them to re-roll that attack roll once.
#### Fire-Eater
Crowds delight in tales of dragons, demons and other strange and powerful creatures. And what better way to bring these tales to life than to have a fire-eater breathe the fire of a dragon’s breath or the flames of hell before the audience’s very eyes. The name “fire-eater” is a bit of a misnomer though. You don’t actually eat the fire, you breathe it out.
* You are proficient in intimidation or performance.
* You have fire breathing equipment and you know how to use it. This grants you the following ability:
  **Fire breath** (action): You breathe fire at a nearby foe. Target a creature within 10ft of you.

This damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 16th level.
#### Jester
Dressed in a gaudy outfit, with bells on your feet and a pig’s bladder on a stick in hand you looked a ridiculous sight. The look was enhanced by the nonsense you used to spout, riddles and rhymes that had no real meaning. And yet if your audience listened carefully they would be able to pick out a method in your madness. Your job was to impart wisdom to high and low alike in a manner that ensured they did not lose face. You have become an expert in sizing up a person and nudging them along with a well placed pun.
* You are proficient in either insight or performance.
* Whenever you roll a natural 1 on a charisma based ability check or saving throw you may re-roll the dice once.
#### Magician
Ok, you’re not a real magician. You don’t actually know how to cast spells. Or perhaps you do. Either way, that wasn’t what you performed on stage. Even in a world of high magic, simple sleight of hand and showmanship can still wow audiences. It is also a useful skill to distract enemies.
* You are proficient in either performance or sleight of hand.
* You gain the following ability, which you can use once between each short or long rest:
  **Misdirect** (reaction): When a creature hits you with an attack that targets only you, you may force them to make a wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 plus your performance bonus. If they fail then the attack misses instead.
#### Musician

* You have proficiency with two musical instruments of your choice.
* You have one of each of the musical instruments that you are proficient with.

* You are proficient in either acrobatics or performance.

You are patient until the time comes to strike, at which point you do with overwhelming force. Choose a terrain type in which you have experience in hunting. While you are in that terrain type you may hide yourself, even if you are only lightly obscured, and have advantage on all rolls to do so.

**Ability score increase: Dexterity or Wisdom**
#### Animal Whisperer
The smaller beasts of this world provide an excellent source of information on where larger creatures may be hiding. You have learnt how to communicate in a rudimentary fashion with such creatures.

* You may communicate simple ideas with small or smaller beasts.
* You may train a small beast to be a pet if you catch one and spend a couple of hours over 2 or 3 days training it.

* You are proficient in either acrobatics or animal handling.
* You have a climbing speed of 20ft.

In any case you have connections with one of the law enforcing groups in the world. You may call on them for reasonable amounts of information, aid, and assistance. 

**Ability score increase: Strength or Intelligence**
#### Arcane Investigator
The only thing worse than a criminal is a criminal who uses magic. Tracking down crimes when the criminal can teleport themselves into and out of the crime scene is bloody difficult.

* You are proficient in persuasion.
* You know one additional language of your choice.
* People will occasionally recognise you as a person with knowledge of the law and ask you to adjudicate on legal matters for them.
#### Mortician
The old adage says that dead men tell no tales, but that is only because most people don’t know how to read them. You have spent much of your life examining corpses and have a keen eye for little details that tell you how someone died and under what circumstances. This fascination with corpses may seem to others to be a bit weird, and it is, but it is also very useful.
* You are proficient in either investigation or medicine.
* You are proficient in all checks made to examine corpses, working out how they died, how long they have been dead etc. If you are already proficient in the skill being made to make the ability check then you may double your proficiency bonus.

Perhaps you hustle people for money, perhaps you are a spy for a king, perhaps you just like to learn others secrets. You know one additional language that is used in the region in which you work.

**Ability score increase: Intelligence or Charisma**
#### Forger
Kings and lords do not go in person to order their guards to unseal the vault and remove a chest of jewels, they send their servants to do it with a signed order. And if that signed order just happens to not be from the king or lord, then someone else might end up with a chest of jewels themselves. You are an expert in copying seals, forging signatures, and imitating the writing style of others.

* You are proficient with forger’s kits.
* You start the game with a forger’s kit.

* When you are passing yourself off as another specific person or creature you may double your proficiency bonus if you have heard the target that you are attempting to imitate speak for at least a minute.

* You are proficient in perception.
* You can lip read, while making a perception check to attempt to do so you may double your proficiency bonus.

* You know how to read and write three languages of your choosing.
* You know how to create ciphers to record information. Deciphering any of your encoded text without the proper key requires the creature attempting to decipher them to pass an intelligence check with a DC of your intelligence score plus your proficiency bonus.

You may call on them for a limited amount of aid, intel, and shelter.

**Ability score increase: Strength or Constitution**
#### Cavalry
Life in the cavalry is mostly just maneuvering about the battlefield on your mount, followed by a few seconds of exhilaration as you charge, and then a minute of panic as you try to escape from the melee to reform. You learnt how to use your mount to its best effect. You also learnt how to protect it, after all a cavalry soldier with no mount is not going to last long. You gain the following benefits while mounted:
* You have advantage on all melee attacks against unmounted creatures that are smaller than your mount.
* You can force any attack that targets your mount to target you instead.
#### Infantry

#### Officer
You were an officer of a high enough rank to be put in charge of leading men in the field. Choose one benefit from the Battle Tactics: Leader background.
#### Quartermaster
An army marches on its stomach, and you were in charge of feeding that stomach. You made sure that the supply train for your company was all in order and that the food and bandages that are vital to an army’s survival were in place.

* You are proficient in investigation or medicine.
* You are proficient at controlling land vehicles.

* When you use a healer’s kit to stabilise a creature make a medicine check and consult the scale below:

Choose one benefit from the Battle Tactics: Tough section.
### Noble
You were born into a position of privilege in the upper echelons of society. You were raised in a household of immense wealth, in which your family’s every need was seen to by an army of waiters, maids, cooks, grounds-keepers, and a myriad of other staff. You were educated by private tutors, and raised to perform your duties to further your family’s lineage and position. You have a position in one of the noble houses in the world.

Your tutors made sure to school you in the ways of combat. You may choose one feat from the Battle Tactics: Armour Training, Battle Tactics: Melee Weapon Training or Battle Tactics: Ranged Weapon Training backgrounds.
#### Courtier
Although the nobility like to appear refined and detached, underneath they are just as vicious as any common street thug, and twice as ruthless.

You have become quite the expert in playing the dangerous games of diplomacy and favour that happen in many noble courts.
* You are proficient in either deception or persuasion.
* You are always able to gain an audience at a nobel court (unless they are actively opposed to you and/or your party). Note that this gives you a hearing, it does not mean that they will agree with you.

#### Family Business
Although making money is a grubby business it is sometimes required to raise the funds needed to maintain one’s estates. You were sent to observe and even have a hand in running this revenue stream.

* You are proficient in either insight or investigation.
* You have a connection to a business concern owned by your family. This business will provide you with a modest amount of funds or other relevant benefits every so often. Work out the details with your GM.

They will not follow you into dangerous areas and will leave if you frequently put them in danger.

**Ability score increase: Constitution or Charisma**
#### Captain
You wore the captain’s hat and stood at the wheel looking every bit the inspirational commander. Or at least you think you did.

* You are proficient in either athletics or persuasion.
* You can secure free passage for yourself on-board a ship belonging to the merchant guild on whose ships you served. Note that this benefit only applies to you, not to the rest of your party.

* You are proficient in nature.
* You have proficiency with navigator’s tools.
* You start the game with a set of navigator’s tools.
#### Pirate
You sailed under the fearsome flag of a pirate company. Often the sight of your ship alone would be enough to convince the ships you raided to hand over their valuables.

* You are proficient in either acrobatics or intimidation.
